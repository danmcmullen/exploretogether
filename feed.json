Case filed and hopefully, fingers crossed, it can be recovered. FUTURE ME: It was not recovered, I was pick-pocketed. \n\nTrying to put this aside we arrive in Venice and look for a water bus to get us to the [Hotel Castello](http://www.hotelcastello.it/). \n\nNOTE: I would not recommend having multiple pieces of luggage when using public transportation. Two weeks worth of clothes is not easy to move around on crowded busses or through the narrow cobblestone streets. \n\nOnce checked in to our hotel we head out for dinner at [Aciugheta](https://maps.apple.com/?address=Castello%204357,%20Campo%20Santi%20Filippo%20e%20Giacomo,%2030122%20Venice,%20Italy&auid=4792151529818674335&ll=45.435187,12.341523&lsp=9902&q=Aciugheta&t=m) and then wander through the streets to explore the city and pick up the last few souvenirs in the short time we have.\n\nSince my iPhone is gone I used Robin's to get our pictures in Venice. \n\n![Historical bridge over a narrow canal with gondolas passing below flanked by old buildings in Venice.

So many things appear to be optional when driving in Rome: signals, speed limits, the lines on the road, and personal space to name just a few. \n\nThanks to the early pickup and our driver's \"skill\" we arrived almost an hour early for our scheduled check in. Dropped our luggage with a porter who happily brought us to an ATM after he found our driver didn't, wouldn't?, take credit card payment and cleaned out what cash we had with us. \n\nWe breezed through the easiest check in we have ever experienced (if only flying could be this easy), checked out our room, then started the tour of the ship, grabbed a snack and drink at the buffet in the Ocean View Cafe, and then headed for the pool. \n\nWe got ourselves cleaned up for dinner and headed to the main dining room. \n\nAfter an excellent meal we headed to the Celebrity Theatre to see the Alfreda Gerald: Aretha Franklin Tribute followed by the True or False game show and some pub trivia in the Reflections lounge to cap off a very long day. \n\n🗺\n",
