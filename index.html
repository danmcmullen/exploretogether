			 <p>Last day in Europe, we grab a couple of pastries for breakfast and head to the <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?address=Riva%20degli%20Schiavoni%204088,%2030122%20Venice,%20Italy&amp;auid=13720896729507973013&amp;ll=45.433885,12.343279&amp;lsp=9902&amp;q=Monumento%20a%20Vittorio%20Emanuele%20II&amp;t=m">Monumento a Vittorio Emanuele II</a> to meet our airport water taxi.</p>

<p>One hour later we are at the airport, get checked in, through security, and waiting at the gate for our first flight, 8.5 hours to Montreal.</p>
<p>Once again noise cancelling headphones and inflight entertainment made the flight just fly (pun intended) by. We were fed a full lunch along with snacks provided twice during this flight. Is this only on international flights? I have never had the same service when flying domestically.</p>
<p>Once in Montreal we had a seven hour layover before we could catch our one hour flight back honey to Halifax. We grabbed a meal at the Pork and Pickle and then found a quiet area at an unused gate, put on our headphones, and watched a couple of episodes of <a href="https://trakt.tv/shows/clarkson-s-farm">Clarkson&rsquo;s Farm</a>.</p>
<p>The last flight home was delayed, slightly, due to the pilots coming in on a delayed flight.</p>
<p>1:03 am on June 16 we landed back at Halifax Stanfield International with our daughters MacKenzie and Lorien waiting to pick us up.</p>
<p>After thirteen months of planning and fifteen days of travelling we come to the end of our honeymoon, 20 years late, our first cruise, and our first vacation with just the two of us.</p>
<p>We have already started talking about the next one! Maybe the another cruise, this time in the Southern Caribbean in early 2026?</p>

			 <p>Last morning on board started early to prepare for our transfer to Venice. There were no direct options left so we were taking a bus from Ravenna to Bologna and then a train into Venice.</p>

</a>

</p>
<p>The call to the bus came just after 8am so we headed for the gangway to exit the ship for the last time, collect our luggage and get it loaded in to the bus.</p>
<p>An hour later we were in Bologna outside of the train station. This where the fun ends. The bus stops and it opens its doors and a few people including myself exit the bus. I was on the side walk and Robin was still on board, it closes its doors and pulls away. It was blocking traffic so the driver moved farther down the street. To get to it I needed to go through a crowd of people waiting to get on another bus to get to our luggage.</p>
<p>We pick up our luggage and head for the train station. Shortly after this I realized I did not put my iPhone in my sling bag but put in my shorts pocket and it is no longer there.</p>
<p>Panic, and anger, sets in. I retrace my steps back to the bus but it is no where to be found. Using Robin&rsquo;s iPhone I logged in to my Find My to mark my phone as lost and followed it moving away from the train station. Next I set it to be erased.</p>
<p>While on the train looking in Find My I see it show up at what looks like a bus depot. Thinking maybe I was not pick-pocketed and it may still be on the bus I called Celebrity to see if they can contact their bus line and see for it can be found. Case filed and hopefully, fingers crossed, it can be recovered. FUTURE ME: It was not recovered, I was pick-pocketed.</p>
<p>Trying to put this aside we arrive in Venice and look for a water bus to get us to the <a href="http://www.hotelcastello.it/">Hotel Castello</a>.</p>
<p>NOTE: I would not recommend having multiple pieces of luggage when using public transportation. Two weeks worth of clothes is not easy to move around on crowded busses or through the narrow cobblestone streets.</p>
<p>Once checked in to our hotel we head out for dinner at <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?address=Castello%204357,%20Campo%20Santi%20Filippo%20e%20Giacomo,%2030122%20Venice,%20Italy&amp;auid=4792151529818674335&amp;ll=45.435187,12.341523&amp;lsp=9902&amp;q=Aciugheta&amp;t=m">Aciugheta</a> and then wander through the streets to explore the city and pick up the last few souvenirs in the short time we have.</p>
<p>Since my iPhone is gone I used Robin&rsquo;s to get our pictures in Venice.</p>

			 <p>Our last day of the cruise is a sea day on our way to Ravenna.</p>
<p>Today started the same as yesterday with a lot of rain that cleared quickly while we were at breakfast, which was again a full house.</p>
<p>The morning activity was a lecture in the theatre, Beyond the Podium: Venice: The Floating City by <a href="https://baillylectures.com/">John W. Bailly</a> giving some history and insights into the creation of Venice. Following the lecture we started re-packing our suitcases for the journey home.</p>
<p>Taking a break we had a quick lunch and then went to the Celebrity Activities Team: Murder Mystery - a musical trivia, not even close to the top score, and a little shopping before retiring our room to finish the packing. We wanted to get our luggage out before heading to dinner to be collected for an easier disembarkation. Packing the souvenirs we purchased was proving difficult as our bags were pretty full when we got here and we still had Venice to visit.</p>
<p>One last visit to the main dining room for another excellent meal followed by the last show in the Celebrity Theatre and a walk around the ship.</p>

<p>Luckily we were not planning an early departure this morning and arrived at the breakfast buffet to see some incredibly dark skies before the rain started. Well we got rain, almost horizontal rain, for at least a half an hour. Once we found a table we grabbed some breakfast and settled in to wait for the skies to clear before heading in to town.</p>
<p>Since we were docked close it was just a short 15 minute walk to the edge of the old city and the market stalls.</p>
<p>We toured the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian%27s_Palace">Diocletian&rsquo;s Palace</a> along with its [Basement Halls](https:/ visitsplit.croatia.hr/en-gb/diocletians-palace-basement-halls) built in the 4th century AD. After the palace we wandered through the old city, souvenir hunting and trying the local gelato before returning the market stalls for more souvenirs then back to the ship, the pool deck and the bar.</p>

<p>Conditions were great in the Bay of Kotor but worsened as we approached the Blue Cave and had to turn back, the water was too choppy for ours, and other boats on similar tours, today.</p>

<p>Back in Kotor we stopped for lunch at <a href="https://maps.apple.com/?address=Museum%20square,%2085339%20Starigrad%20Kotor,%20Montenegro&amp;auid=2776564548754185519&amp;ll=42.424835,18.771387&amp;lsp=9902&amp;q=Restoran%20Giardino&amp;t=h">Restoran Giardino</a> and then strolled around the old city before catching a tender back to the ship.</p>
<p>The early start and the sun have taken their toll and we are exhausted, fell asleep by the pool, thankfully out of the sun.</p>
<p>We stayed on the pool deck to watch the Constellation sail out of Kotor Bay with the cliffs high above the boat and headed to the buffet for dinner.</p>

			 <p>We were off the ship around 9 am and on a shuttle bus heading into Dubrovnik to explore the old city and to
<a href="https://citywallsdubrovnik.hr/the-city-walls/">walk the wall</a>. Approximately 2 km from start to finish and just over a thousand stairs with little to no shade in the 26°C heat. A great way to spend a Monday morning!</p>

<p>This was the entrance to the wall with approximately 100 fairly steep steps up. I stopped counting before I got to the top, just concentrated on breathing and hoped my knees would make it.</p>

<p>With the heat taking its toll we made our way back the shuttle bus pick up location.</p>
<p>This is probably the only issue we&rsquo;ve had on the entire cruise. The company Celebrity contracted the busses from had little to no organization and crowd control in place. We waited a long time in full sun before a bus to come only to have to wait for another one as the back of the line rushed forward taking seats from those of us who had been in line from almost an hour.</p>
<p>Back on board the Constellation we made our way to pool deck to cool down before heading to dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner we saw a <a href="https://www.crazyjuggler.com/">Pete Matthews: the Crazy Juggler</a> in the theatre. This was definitely one of the best shows we have seen. He came on stage at full speed and never slowed down.</p>

<p>Breakfast at the buffet was a mad house. People were walking in every direction, lines meant nothing and some, many, felt it was ok to stop in the middle of traffic for no apparent reason. We had to walk around the entire cafe twice to find a table.</p>
<p>Next, we hopped on the cruise shuttle into the old town and walked the waterfront and through some of the side streets to get a feel of some history of the town.</p>

<p>A two hour walk felt a lot longer in the 32°C heat, not a lot of shade near the waterfront so we jumped back on the cruise shuttle to get a late lunch and find a spot by the pool for the afternoon.</p>
<p>Eating late meant we skipped the main dining room and grabbed a late dinner before heading to the Theatre for the Alfreda Gerald: Tina Turner Tribute.</p>

<p>A hot, but thankfully breezy, walk around the old town showed us some photo opportunities but little in the way of shopping. Most were still closed as we made our way back for the ship around 11:30 am.</p>

<p>Back on the ship we settled in by the pool with some Mojitos.</p>
<p>This led to more Mojitos, and more Mojitos, and&hellip;</p>

<p>Took a break for supper in the main dining room and then more Mojitos, it is vacation! The Mojitos kept flowing all night, we lost count.</p>
<p>Wandered the ship for a while, took in some trivia, saw the production cast masked dancers, and then danced to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thewavesbanduk/">The Waves Band</a> in the Reflections Lounge.</p>

			 <p>We started early, very early, to get ready for today&rsquo;s excursion to Florence with a 90+ minute bus ride.</p>
<p>Starting at the Piazza di Santa Croce we walked up to the Cathedral of Santa Maria del Fiore, Piazza del Duomo, before having lunch at the smallest sandwich shop we have ever seen, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/paninitoscanifirenze?igsh=MWoyYnR3MTFoNWhobQ==">Panini Toscani</a>.

<p>We get picked up early by another crazy driver. So many things appear to be optional when driving in Rome: signals, speed limits, the lines on the road, and personal space to name just a few.</p>
<p>Thanks to the early pickup and our driver&rsquo;s &ldquo;skill&rdquo; we arrived almost an hour early for our scheduled check in. Dropped our luggage with a porter who happily brought us to an ATM after he found our driver didn&rsquo;t, wouldn&rsquo;t?, take credit card payment and cleaned out what cash we had with us.</p>
<p>We breezed through the easiest check in we have ever experienced (if only flying could be this easy), checked out our room, then started the tour of the ship, grabbed a snack and drink at the buffet in the Ocean View Cafe, and then headed for the pool.</p>
<p>We got ourselves cleaned up for dinner and headed to the main dining room.</p>
<p>After an excellent meal we headed to the Celebrity Theatre to see the Alfreda Gerald: Aretha Franklin Tribute followed by the True or False game show and some pub trivia in the Reflections lounge to cap off a very long day.</p>

<p>In Montreal we had a two hour layover at a gate three or four times smaller than needed with nowhere to sit and absolutely no airflow.</p>
<p>After what appeared to be a free for all boarding the plane we were on our way. A short seven hour flight later we landed in Rome at 9:30 am local time.</p>
<p>Our first day in Rome was busy starting with taking a bus from the airplane to the airport, apparently an airplane still at our gate was in the middle of a repair not able to be moved. Once in the terminal we waited at least an hour for our luggage. Pretty sure they were the last ones off the plane.</p>
<p>At a friends suggestion we had hired a car for transportation to the hotel. Would definitely recommend, especially if you have never been to your destination before. We eventually met up with the driver, a lady who could have a former career as a race car driver, and experienced some crazy traffic and crazier drivers while en route to our hotel.</p>
<p>We had booked a tour for the Colosseum, Roman Forum, Palatine Hill, and the Mamertine Prison that should have allowed us to bypass the lines. Two days before we left for Rome the tour operator contacted us and told us their tour was cancelled due to the first Sunday of the month being free entry day to almost all major attractions in Rome. We did not know this when booking our vacation. We would not recommend, spoiler, the lines were insanely long.</p>
<p>After dropping our luggage at the hotel we headed to the Colosseum in the rain to see if we could beat the lines. We could not.</p>

</p>
<p>While looking for the line to pick up our free tickets we happened on a &ldquo;tourist ambassador&rdquo; who helped get us a replacement for our cancelled tour. Not gonna lie, this was giving us a real scam vibe but turned out to be legit.</p>
<p>The tour started in the line for tickets, because of the &ldquo;free entry day&rdquo; each person must pick up their own. We had 45 minutes of Rome history from the tour guide while we waited to pickup our tickets and then 45 minutes within the Colosseum itself ending up over looking the arena floor.</p>

<p>We had enough of the lines and the heat and headed back to the hotel. On the way we found <a href="https://www.pizzadellamadonnadeimonti.it/">pizzadellamadonna</a> tucked into a side street and stopped in our first authentic Italian pizza and then retired for the evening exhausted.</p>

			 <p>Almost thirteen months ago we put the deposit down on our first big trip where it is just the two of us. This is a late honeymoon and an early 20th anniversary, August in the Mediterranean is way too hot for me.</p>
<p>An 11 night cruise, our first (only?), around Italy and Croatia. We start in Rome, flying in a day early and finish with an extra night in Venice. We will be trying to get some touristy things just before and after the cruise.</p>
<p>The packing is almost done, still working on getting everything under the airline limits, and we leave in 17 hours.</p>
